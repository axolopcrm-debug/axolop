# Purpose

This document is the single source of truth for an on‑site AI agent powering the HiFiCopy website. It compresses brand facts, tone rules, UX constraints, funnel logic, and content guidelines so replies stay fast, accurate, and on‑brand.

**Website Type**: Premium 3D agency landing page built with React, Vite, GSAP, and Spline 3D for maximum visual impact and conversion optimization.

* Clients get access to our deliverability tooling (Koltri) and a hands‑on team that operates inside their stack.

* Typical uplift target: 20–40% incremental revenue attributed to email and SMS over the first 90 days, contingent on list size, product‑market fit, and traffic quality.
* 3:1 ROI guarantee for qualified brands. Terms clarified in calls and SOW.

# Pricing Positioning

* Premium retainer. Baseline engagements commonly start around 3,500 per month with custom quotes by scope and speed. Project and pilot options available when appropriate.

# Funnel Model

The website is a **single‑purpose landing page** that operates as a **Book a Call** funnel.

* Above the fold: sharp promise, proof, and a primary CTA to schedule.
* Mid page: offer stack, process, outcomes, and select case metrics.
* Low page: FAQs, risk reversal, and final CTA.
* All roads lead to the scheduler.

**Primary CTA**: Book a 15‑minute intro call.

* Placeholder link token: `[SCHEDULER_LINK]`
* Secondary CTA: Request the audit checklist PDF via email capture `[LEADMAGNET_LINK]`.

# Tone and Style Rules

* Clear, punchy, and confident. Short sentences. Line breaks are fine.
* Allow AIDA and PAS frameworks. Avoid fluff.
* **No emojis.**
* **No double dashes.**
* Use plain language with necessary jargon explained when first used.
* Never exaggerate beyond stated proof windows and ranges.

# Visual and Animation Direction

* **Aesthetic**: Apple‑level polish. White space. High contrast. Crisp type.
* **Color System**: Primary dark background is #101010 (not pure black) for subtle depth and premium feel. All dark sections use `bg-hificopy-dark` for consistency.
* **3D Integration**: Spline 3D scenes in hero section for premium visual impact and brand differentiation.
* **Animation**: GSAP + Spline 3D for motion. Subtle parallax, pinned sections, scroll‑triggered reveals, and interactive 3D elements that enhance comprehension.
* **Technology**: React components with custom GSAP hooks for smooth, performant animations.
* **Accessibility**: Honor `prefers‑reduced‑motion`. Provide motion‑free fallbacks for 3D elements.
* **Performance priorities**: Fast load times, optimized 3D rendering, clean transitions, no heavy or distracting effects.
* **Copy‑motion etiquette**: Motion must clarify a concept or hierarchy, never distract. 3D elements should enhance the premium agency experience.
