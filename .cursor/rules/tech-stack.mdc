# 🔌 Integrations & Events

## Klaviyo
- Install via app + site snippet in `theme.liquid`.  
- Track: `trial_started`, `license_issued`, `upgrade_clicked`, `club_subscribed`.  
- Lists/segments: `analyzer_trial`, `club_members`, `high_intent`.

## Subscriptions (Recharge/Appstle)
- SKU: **Axolop Club** (monthly/annual).  
- Cart/checkout: ensure drawer supports subscription line items and $0 trials (if used).

## Digital Delivery & Licensing
- Attach installers/keys to the `$0 trial` and paid products.  
- Expiry/renewal webhooks → tag users (`trial_expired`, `license_revoked`) and email via Klaviyo.  
- Use Mechanic (optional) for license rotation, tagging, and trial reminders.

## Analytics & CRO
- **GA4**, **Meta**, **TikTok** pixels in `theme.liquid`.  
- **PostHog (optional):** only if light; track the 4 events above.  
- **A/B testing:** prefer server-side via app; if client-side, ensure no CLS and cache-safety.  
- **JSON-LD**: `SoftwareApplication` for analyzer product/page.

# 🧩 Metafields/Metaobjects (content modeling)

- **Metaobject: testimonials** → name, role, quote, avatar, rating, proof link.  
- **Metaobject: partner_studios** → name, logo, URL.  
- **Metafields (product/page):** feature_bullets, comparison_rows, faq_items, media_urls.

*Cursor: when adding new content types, prefer metaobjects so marketing can scale without code.*

# 🧪 QA & Checklists (run before push)

**Functional**
- All CTAs resolve (Hero, sticky, pricing, final).  
- Trial flow: add to cart → license email → thank-you page with install steps.  
- Subscription purchase works with drawer + checkout.

**UX**
- Mobile-first: hero fits ≤ 640px, sticky CTA not overlapping.  
- Comparison table scrolls on mobile with shadow affordance.  
- Video sections lazy-load and have poster images.

**Perf**
- LCP ≤ 1.0s on desktop, ≤ 1.8s on mobile for landing page.  
- Image weights optimized; JS under control (no >150KB uncompressed per page).  
- No console errors, 0 broken links.

**SEO**
- Unique `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`.  
- Canonical tag set; alt text present; JSON-LD validates.

**Accessibility**
- Keyboard nav full; visible focus states; landmarks (header, main, footer).
