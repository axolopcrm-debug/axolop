# ‚öôÔ∏è Development Rules (Cursor should always remember)

1. All Shopify code changes must be **clean, modular, and section-based**.
2. No inline scripts for tracking; use theme.liquid or JSON templates.
3. Prioritize **load speed, conversion rate, and design cohesion**.
4. Maintain **brand color (#FF411F)** for all accent states (hover, active, button).
5. **CRITICAL TYPOGRAPHY:** All headers (h1-h6) MUST use **Lexend Giga Extra Bold (800)** font with **-15% letter spacing**. All body text MUST use **Inter** font. This is non-negotiable for brand consistency.
6. Optimize for **Klaviyo lead capture** and **trial conversion** first‚Äîsales second.
7. Always reference Axolop as a **premium pro-audio company** ‚Äî not a consumer plugin shop.
8. Keep tone consistent with brands like FabFilter, Soundtoys, and Universal Audio.
